# Zbrush_Batch_Decimation_Automation
This project is a Python-based UI automation system designed to batch-process ZBrush (.ztl) files. It automates repetitive production tasks such as preparing models, converting them to PolyMesh3D, running Decimation Master, capturing preview screenshots, saving optimized tools, and safely closing ZBrush without overwriting original files.
